# Insect-Classification-Project
For this project, a pretrained model is used to classify different images of pest insects & recognize what species they belong to. The goal is to train the model so it's able to recognize any species when given any image.

The dataset used is from HuggingFace. The pretrained model used is the EfficientNet-B1 model. To learn how to use these items, go to the "Project Dataset, Model, & Recording" md file.

To run the code, you have two options: you can try to use the Jupyter Scource file & open it in a IDE that supports this format or use the python file & run every part of it at the saem time.

THe only true depenedencies are the continued availability of the dataset withing the HuggingFace website, relying on GPU to run the code unless a stronger system is used, & which file format you are able to use in your given IDE.
